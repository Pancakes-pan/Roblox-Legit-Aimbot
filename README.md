# Roblox-Soft-Aimlock
A Lua script developed in my free time that provides a configurable soft aim-assist system for FPS (First Person Shooter) games.


# Lua Aim Assist
This is just a little Lua script I put together in my free time. It adds a soft aim-assist (nothing too snappy, more smooth/legit looking).
It’s not meant to be anything crazy, mostly just me messing around with targeting logic, raycasting, and camera control.

Soft aim assist with smoothing + a bit of jitter so it looks natural
Wall checks so it doesn’t aim through solid objects
Team checks so you don’t lock onto your own team
Keybind (L by default) to toggle the aimbot on/off

# Execution
Well obviously you will need an *executor* (i listed some popular ones for each platform below) for executing the script

<pre> loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pancakes-pan/Roblox-Soft-Aimlock/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))() </pre>

# Executors
In the Roblox scripting world, executors are special programs that let you run custom Lua scripts inside Roblox
Normally, Roblox only allows scripts that are part of the game itself. Executors “inject” your script into the game client so it runs alongside everything else
including my script you will *need* an executor to execute any script.

We all know how hard it is to find an actual executor for specific platforms and let alone be safe
So please consider checking out Voxlis.net if you want to pick an executor but not sure which one, you can find cons and pros about every executor, key systems, payments 
and direct link to their official websites.
