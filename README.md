# Roblox-Soft-Aimlock
A Lua script developed in my free time that provides a configurable soft aim-assist system for FPS (First Person Shooter) games.


# Lua Aim Assist
This is just a little Lua script I put together in my free time. It adds a soft aim-assist (nothing too snappy, more smooth/legit looking).
It’s not meant to be anything crazy, mostly just me messing around with targeting logic, raycasting, and camera control.

Soft aim assist with smoothing + a bit of jitter so it looks natural
Wall checks so it doesn’t aim through solid objects
Team checks so you don’t lock onto your own team
Keybind (L by default) to toggle the aimbot on/off

# Execution
Well obviously you will need an *executor* (i listed some popular ones for each platform below) for executing the script

<pre> ```lua loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pancakes-pan/Roblox-Soft-Aimlock/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))() ``` </pre>
